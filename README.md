<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/zezhong-zhang/DeepMD-EM)

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is widely used for probing the crystal structure, chemistry and electronic structure at the atomic scale. To quantify the observed signals, we need to run detailed electron scattering simulations using the multislice algorithm -- treating materials as collections of slices (i.e. atomic planes) that electrons get scattered at those slices and freely propagate between slices. 

Among different contributions, thermal diffuse scattering dominates the observed diffraction intensities at high angles. Since the incident electrons travel fast as compared to the vibration period of the atoms, the atoms are seen as a frozen snapshot. The traditional frozen phonon calculation uses the uncorrelated Einstein model of phonons generation that displaces atoms in 2D with Dybe-Waller factors extracted from bulk experimental measurements or simulations. This approach clearly breaks down for atoms at the surface of nanoparticles or at the interface of heterophase which are of general interest to material science. In addition, the detailed phonon correlation and anisotropy may affect the fine structure of imaging, diffraction and spectroscopy that are largely unexplored until now. 

To close this gap, here we developed a workflow (based on dflow) to use realistic phonon configurations generated from deep potential molecular dynamics for electron scattering simulations. For the molecular dynamics, we designed a heating strategy to reach the targeted thermal equilibrium with DeepMD potential and EAM potential tested. For the scattering simulation, the STEM intensity was calculated for each phonon configuration and then incoherently summed over phonon configurations. After testing the bulk crystal cases, we will explore surfaces, interfaces and crystal defects which are otherwise difficult for conventional frozen phonon scattering simulations. 

The code is still in its early stage and heavily under development.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get code running locally, let's first create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n deepmd-em python=3.8
conda activate deepmd-em
```

Then, install the required packages.

### Prerequisites

* dflow
```sh
pip install pydflow
```
* python-multem
```sh
export CUDACXX=${PATH_TO_CUDA}/bin/nvcc
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/python-multem.git@master
```
* lammps-dp
```sh
conda install -c deepmodeling lammps-dp
```
* phononpy
```sh
pip install phonopy
```
* phonoLAMMPS
```sh
pip install phonoLAMMPS
```
### Installation

Then we can install the DeepMD-EM code.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zezhong-zhang/DeepMD-EM.git
pip install -e DeepMD-EM
```
